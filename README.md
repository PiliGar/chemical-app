    - Display other chemicals found in these patent nos. (separately for each excel, see screenshot)
  - The tables should contain two columns: found chemical names, count of
    patents in which they appear
    - Each table should contain a search and an order option o Each row should be clickable

* On row click: Create a second page that displays the document information
* Document information should be displayed as a table with the patent no., title, and a
  hyperlink to the google patents page
* Provide appropriate error messages for handling non-availability of data

**Bonus points**:

- Import the data from given spreadsheets into a suitable database (additional bonus points
  if done in Neo4j)
